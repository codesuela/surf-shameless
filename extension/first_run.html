        <h1>
            Thank you for installing (surf) shameless
        </h1>

        <div class="inner_step ui-corner-all ui-widget-content">
            (surf) shameless protects you from embarrassment by selectively deleting entries from your browsing history
            and/or intercepting requests to blacklisted sites.
            Beyond that it allows you to add private bookmarks which are only visible after you enter your password.
            <br />
            <b>So first of all you should set up your password: </b>
            <br />
            <input type="text" id="ef_password" /> <label for="ef_password">Password</label>
            <br />
            If you loose your password all your bookmarks and custom entries will be gone so you can enter a password
            hint which you can view later in case you forget your password. As everybody using your browser is able
            to view the password hint you should choose it wisely because if it is to obvious it would defeat
            the purpose of using a password at all, so choose wisely.
            <br />
            <input type="text" id="ef_hint" /> <label for="ef_hint">Password hint</label>
            <br />
            <b><i>Note: you can leave both fields empty, however it is recommended to use a password</i></b>
            <br />

        </h1>
        <div class="inner_step ui-corner-all ui-widget-content">
            (surf) shameless implements two modes of operation, you have to choose one
            <p></p>
            <form id="op_mode_form" accept="" action="#">

                    <br />

                    <b>Will delete blacklisted entries every time you start Chrome and close offending tabs</b>.<br />
                    This is the least invasive mode. It will make sure your browsing history will look clean to
                    other people who take a peak. Offending sites will still show up briefly in the recently closed tabs
                    section.
                </div>
                <p></p>

                    <label for="op_mode_preventive">Preventive mode</label>
                    <br />

                    <b>This will redirect blacklisted sites to a incognito window</b> whose contents will be discarded once you close
                    the window. Just to be safe the extension will scan your history for offending entries and purge them.
                    As this will pop up a new window each time you visit a blacklisted site this mode is not quite as seemless
                    as one might wish.

           To provide better lists in the future and for general amusement I would like to build a list of
           the most embarrassing sites on the web. To achieve that goal I would need you to agree to allow this
           extension to transmit sites you've added to your list.
            <br />
            <b>This will happen in a completely anonymous fashion</b><br />
           Nothing beyond the site you added will be added to our database.<br />
           Nothing that could identify you will be retained or transmitted.<br />
           For what it's worth, both the code of this extension and the receiving end are open source and available on
           Github.
