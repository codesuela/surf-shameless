        <h1>
            Thank you for installing the embarrassment filter
        </h1>
        <p>
            eFilter protects you from embarrassment by selectively deleting entries from your browsing history.
            Beyond that it allows you to add private bookmarks which are only visible after you enter your password.
            <br />
            <b>So first of all you should set up your password: </b>
            <br />
            <input type="text" id="ef_password" /> <label for="ef_password">Password</label>
            <br />
            If you loose your password all your bookmarks and custom entries will be gone so you can enter a password
            hint which you can view later in case you forget your password. As everybody using your browser is able
            to view the password hint you should choose it wisely because if it is to obvious it would defeat
            the purpose of using a password at all, so choose wisely.
            <br />
            <input type="text" id="ef_hint" /> <label for="ef_hint">Password hint</label>
            <br />
            <b><i>Note: you can leave both fields empty, however it is recommended to use a password</i></b>
            <br />
            <input type="submit" value="next" class="next_btn">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="step2" class="step" step="2">
        <h1>
            Select the mode of operation
        </h1>
        <p>
           eFilter implements two modes of operation, you have to choose one
            <br />
            <div>
                <input type="radio" id="mode_retroactive" group="op_mode" />
                <h3>Retroactive mode</h3>
                <br />
                Will blacklisted entries every time you start Chrome and close offending tabs.<br />
                This is the least invasive mode. It will make sure your browsing history will look clean to
                other people who take a peak. Offending sites will still show up briefly in the recently closed tabs
                section.
            </div>
            <div>
                <input type="radio" id="mode_preventive" group="op_mode" />
                <h3>Preventive mode</h3>
                <br />
                This will redirect blacklisted sites to a incognito window whose contents will be discarded once you close
                the window. Just to be safe the extension will scan your history for offending entries and purge them.
                As this will pop up a new window each time you visit a blacklisted site this mode is not quite as seemless
                as one might wish.
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <input type="submit" value="next" class="next_btn">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="step3" class="step" step="3">
        <h1>
            Help build the ultimate ranking of embarrassing sites
        </h1>
        <p>
           To provide better lists in the future and for general amusement I would like to build a list of
           the most embarrassing sites on the web. To achieve that goal I would need you to agree to allow this
           extension to transmit sites you've added to your list.
            <br />
            <b>This will happen in a completely anonymous fashion</b><br />
           Nothing beyond the site you added will be added to our database.<br />
           Nothing that could identify you will be retained or transmitted.<br />
           For what it's worth, both the code of this extension and the receiving end are open source and available on
           Github.
            <br />
            <br />
           <input type="checkbox" id="ef_allow_remote" /> <label for="ef_allow_remote">Allow transmitting my custom blacklist in an anonymous fashion</label>
            <br /><br />
            <input type="submit" value="next" class="next_btn">

            Almost done...

        <p>
            Alright we're all set now. A few words on how to use this extension.
            You will notice that a new entry has been added to your context menu (the thing that comes up
            when you right click somewhere). Through the entry you can sites to your blacklist and to your private bookmarks.
            Please note that these entries will always be the same even though site might be already present in your blacklist/bookmarks.
            This is simply to protect your privacy.
            To remove entries and to view your private bookmarks, right click the extension icon in the top right and select options.
            Alternatively you can open the extensions page and select options.
            Your history will be cleansed every time you close an embarrassing tab and when you start chrome.
            Note: if you have multiple embarrassing tabs open the history will be cleaned up after you close all of them.
            Clicking the icon will bring up a dialogue that will show you when the last cleanup was performed.

            <br /><br />
            <input type="submit" value="Finish" id="finish" />
