# (surf) shameless

Have you ever been worried what happens if you get hit by a car and your relatives check out your search history to reminisce what kind of person you were?
Are you worried about someone snooping on your browsing history while you are away?
Is you browsing history under constant scrutiny of your girlfriend?
**In all of these cases (surf) shameless is just the extension you need. **
It is your personal blacklist for sites that you don't want to show up in your history. You can add websites and search terms that will be **continually deleted** from your **history**. You can also add **private bookmarks** that will be only visible to you because your blacklist and your bookmarks will be password protected. For the extra paranoid (surf) shameless features a **preventive mode** where every time you visit a blacklisted site you will be redirected to the same page in **incognito** mode. 
As if that is not enough it comes prepackaged with a few lists to allow protect your privacy right away.

### Privacy
Your password is hashed with PBKDF2, all your custom blacklist entries will be AES encrypted, however the key is
stored in plaintext in localStorage so this serves as an obfuscation layer.
